# Factors-Affecting-the-Expectancy-of-Life
Information Visualization Project. 

**AIM**:
The aim of this study was to help visualize the life expectancy with effect of immunization and human 
development index, along with other parameters like different diseases, age, living conditions, eating 
habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.

I created a heatmap to better analyze the levels based on color shades going up and down. The darker the 
closer to 1, i.e., higher correlation. Whereas the lighter it is the more non correlated are the parameters. 

**Dataset**: 
The data was taken for this project from Kaggle. It is from 193 countries which was collected in between 
the years 2000-2015. The data came from the WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic 
data was collected from United Nation website. 
To read the data, I was structured into a data frame to perform further analysis by visualizing it in different 
forms. The visualizations following also helped elaborate on the main figure of this project, which is the 
heatmap.

**Findings and Discussions:**
Both the x and y axis have the same list of parameters. The same ones collide in the middle and form a 
diagonal which represents the number 1 and the darkest shade of red as it shows the maximum correlation, 
i.e in such cases the factor let alone can be a big reason to affect the life expectancy. The last figure and the 
first figure prove this. The developed countries are less affected by some factors compared to developing 
countries. The range plot is a representation of that. 
This project was one way to bring out the visualization for the life expectancy in the whole wide world. 
There could be many other factors affecting it and could have different analysis. But I feel what is going to 
remain constant is when two factors of the same kind come together it becomes a major causes, like above 
it reaches maximum probability of affecting the life expectancy. This visualization if worked further can 
help countries work through the factors that affect the Life expectancy of their population.
